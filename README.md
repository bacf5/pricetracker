## Description

## Motivation

As an amateur padel player, I was always interested in having the best equipment or being aware of the latest offers. While learning Next.js I decided to create this website to receive discounts on the products that interest me, follow them and see when is the best time to buy them! Directly to my inbox.

## Future Ideas

- ~~Redirect when you search a product~~
- ~~Modal when you click in "Comprar"~~
- Add a search bar
- ~~Mobile friendly~~

> Momentally, it's only for Padel Nuestro and checks only the rackets, in the future it will be able to check all the products from the store.
